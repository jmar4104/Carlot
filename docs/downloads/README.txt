Place PNG or JPG document images in this folder to enable downloads from the site.

Example filenames used in the page:
- sample-doc-1.png
- sample-doc-2.jpg

Usage:
- Put your files (e.g., invoice.png, agreement.jpg) in this folder.
- Open `docs/docs.html` in a browser; the "Descargar" links will download the files.

Notes:
- The page uses standard HTML `download` links. For local development (file://) some browsers may open images instead of downloading — test in your server environment or move the files to the web server root.
- If you want me to generate placeholder images for you, tell me the desired filenames and sizes and I'll add them here.
